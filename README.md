# Information
Super Optimized is a Minecraft optimized mod pack for low profile PC
Based on [Simply Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/sop), but adds some other features such as Zoom, shaderpack, Discord RPC, OptiFine resourcepack support...
# Description
Support version: Fabric 1.18.2
(I didn't make a version for Forge, it's quite heavy and hard to find good mods)
# Warning
Do not install mods that use Quilt's API, it may cause modpacks to not work. If you find out how to do this, contact me at [Github](https://github.com/ItzzParsher05)
And I will update the modpack again (Thank you for helping me perfect this modpack)

# Donation?
I make this modpack for free, I don't need support. I do it for everyone who has a low PC configuration but wants to play the game smoothly (I'm also a part)

Thanks for using the modpack I made. Wish you have the best experience
