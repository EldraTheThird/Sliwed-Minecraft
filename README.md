# Information
Super Optimized is a Minecraft optimized mod pack for low profile PC
Based on [Simply Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/sop), but adds some other features such as Zoom, shaderpack, Discord RPC, OptiFine resourcepack support, in-game music player (I have added a playlist of my favorite songs, if you don't like it then just delete it)
# Description
Version support (as of 12/2022): Fabric 1.18.2\
I'm trying to make a modpack for Forge, it's a bit difficult because Forge is quite a heavy modloader, and finding the right mod is also difficult (because quite a few mods really improve performance). But maybe in the future I will do it to satisfy Forge players (lmao)
# Warning
Do not install mods that use Quilt's API, it may cause modpacks to not work. If you find out how to do this, contact me at email chappell2312414@hotmail.com (I will check my email every 48 hours, so please wait :>)\
I will add mods that use Quilt's API (some mods can improve performance)

I would appreciate it if you respect the creator of this modpack (is me)
# Donation?
I make this modpack for free, I don't need support. I do it for everyone who has a low-end PC but wants to play the game smoothly (I'm also a part, bruh)

Thanks for using the modpack I made. Wish you have the best experience
